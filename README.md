Trilemma Foundation Practicum

## Workflow Expectations

### Work cadence
1. Weekly office hour participation is expected (sending questions in advance or attending meetings) 
2. Weekly progress should be visible in your team repository  
3. If nothing is pushed, we assume no work is being done

### Collaboration norms
1. Share intermediate work early, including partial work, and drafts  
2. Ask questions during office hours and in the shared communication channel  
3. Write for clarity, not only correctness. Your work should be readable by a motivated non-expert

## Getting Started

1. Review the Project Launch Slides and confirm you completed all the onboarding steps  
2. Review the Project Launch Slides and confirm you understand the workflow, timeline, and deliverables  
3. Clone the correct template repository for your project 
4. Set up your local environment and validate you can run the starter notebooks  
5. Start an initial exploration of the data
   
## Collection of Team Work

Team repositories will be listed here once teams are finalized and repos are created.
